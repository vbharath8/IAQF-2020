# IAQF-2020

At the center of the 2020 US presidential election,
given a qualitatively selected set of US equities 
that are expected to exhibit differential performance based
on the outcome of elections, we seek to explore if there is
a difference in volatilities using a GARCH model and also
investigate the rolling realized correlation of two portfolios.
Micro-blogs mentioning pairs of companies around elections are
used to identify clusters of stocks that could help delineate the
two portfolios. Other aspects of portfolio returns are examined
to look for any significant differences in factor exposures. We
finally present a simple structured note to take advantage of our
findings.
